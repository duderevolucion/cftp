This is a readme file.

It should be written in restructured text format.

When posted on GitHub, it will become the homepage for the project.

Note there's a "nose" package that integrates with setup.py and
can be used to run test suites on the packages.  I would probably
create a test suite using s3ftp in non-interactive mode.

Packaging directions - see
https://python-packaging.readthedocs.org/en

This page also needs to explain the installation
procedure, step-by-step.

Setup allows inclusion of non-code data files, such
as JSON.  This might be useful for specifying default
S3 parameters.
