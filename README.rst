CLOUD FTP CLIENT
================


Introduction
============

The cftp package provides an ftp-like interface to cloud-based
storage services.  It is basically a wrapper.  It abstracts
the user from the particulars of specific cloud storage services
by exposing a common interface.  Accessing the interface is
simple.  Instantiate a class corresponding to a desired
cloud storage service (eg, Amazon S3).  The class has methods
corresponding to common ftp client commands.  

The current version includes the four files
noted below.

1.  base.py - abstract base class for cloud ftp client
2.  base_exceptions.py - exceptions raised by base.py
3.  s3.py - ftp-like client interface to Amazon's S3 service
4.  s3_exceptions.py - exceptions raised by s3.py
5.  __main__.py - shim for s3ftp command line script (console script)

Over time, this package may be extended to include an
ftp-like client interface to the DropBox storage services.  That
functionality would be implemented as a sub-class of base.py,
just as s3.py is a sub-class.  The same is true for other
cloud-based storage services that offer an API.


Installation
============

Install using *pip* or *easy_install*.  The cftp package does
require Amazon's boto3 package, which exposes an API for controlling
AWS objects using python.  The boto3 package will be automatically
installed (via pip or easy_install), since it is listed as a
dependency in this package.

This package also includes a tool called *s3ftp* that provides 
command line, ftp-like access to the Amazon S3 service.



Configuration
=============

Before using this package, you will need to setup AWS authentication
credentials as required by boto3.  See the following URL:

Using the *s3ftp* Command Line Utility
======================================

The following illustrates using the interactive *s3ftp* command line
utility.  It assumes the existence of an Amazon S3 bucket, in this
this case a notional bucket named *com.s3ftp.test*.

The following connects to a bucket, lists its contents,
changes the remote working directory (in the bucket),
changes the local working directory, creates a directory
in the bucket, uploads a file to it, multiple gets several files,
deletes a file from the bucket, closes the bucket, opens a
new bucket, lists its contents, and quits.  Below does not
show s3ftp output.

    s3ftp com.s3ftp.test
    ls
    cd dir1/dir2
    lcd ~
    mkdir dir3
    put file1
    mget f*.txt
    delete file2
    close
    open com.s3ftp2.test2
    ls
    close
    quit


Note
====

The Amazon S3 client above does not support creation or deletion
of S3 buckets.  It assumes the bucket already exists.  This is
consistent with behavior of a traditional ftp client in that it
is accessing existing storage (on an ftp server).


Changes in this Release
=======================

(1) Using functools.wraps to improve docstring readability
using pydoc.

(2) Added more explanation in README.rst on using the
command line s3ftp utility.
